JukeBoxHero is another similar app that only has access to iTunes. My app will take these concepts and make it friendly for at home music lovers by integrating Spotify as the music hub for which users can make requests from so that the user has a wider selection of music to choose from apart from a specified list. (If successful, later implementations may aim to integrate other music sources such as Google Music, iTunes, etc.)\r\n\r\n### USER PERSONAS\r\nThe target audience will be Android mobile users (ideally) at the same house party. In this case, there will be one person hosting and therefore this person will have oversight of the music queue and be able to invite people to make requests. The other users that have either accepted an invite or requested one will only have the ability to make requests or favorite other requests.\r\n\r\n### INTEGRATIONS\r\n- Background/async jobs for any long running tasks (image processing, 3rd party data manipulation, audio)\r\n- Third party OAuth via Spotify\r\n\r\n![Home Page] (/images/home_page.png) ![Search and Suggestions Page](/images/search_suggestions.png) ![Playlist](/images/playlist.png)\r\n",
